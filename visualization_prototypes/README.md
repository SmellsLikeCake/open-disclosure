# Visualization Prototypes

Using the datasets saved in this folder, create prototype data visualizations with the tools of your choice. 

Visualizations particularly desired are found in the [issues](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/open-disclosure/issues) but any visualization can be submitted.

Add the visualizations to this folder or add a link to this README if they are hosted online.
