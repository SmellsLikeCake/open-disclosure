# Open Disclosure
A web app to track campaign finances for the California Primary Election (March 3, 2020), and the General Election (November 3, 2020. The goal of Open Disclosure is to help voters understand who/what Political Action Committees (PACs) are donating money to the candidates/measures. Are the donors from the same jurisdiction (city/county/state) as the candidate's intended office or outside of the jurisdiction? Are the donors individuals, or Political Action Committees (PACs)? What is the donor history of the PAC(s)? We are inspired by Open Oakland's Open Disclosure: https://www.opendisclosure.io

4. The user will see a list of donors, from highest donation to lowest donation. Include information about the donor like their job and donation amount.
